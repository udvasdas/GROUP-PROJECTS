# GROUP-PROJECTS
Exploratory Data Analysis done by Nilabja Ghosh and Udvas Das.
The project was given to us by Dr. Sudeep Mallick in our first semester. 
On 11th March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak
of the SAARS virus named Covid-19 as a global pandemic. In the past two years, the entire
human race has experienced the most horrific time in the past century. A lot of things have
changed since then including our lifestyles, necessities, day-to-day living etc. Our physical
health, especially our mental health got affected heavily.
Many interesting projects in Biology, Statistics, Environmental sciences have come to
light since the outbreak of the deadly disease. There is a lot of data which has been collected
for these projects.
India reported its first covid case on 30th January, 2020 and after August the real havoc
started. India became the state with second highest case numbers. After a year of immense
struggle and hardship India started to vaccinate its citizens.
 A lot of people in India were sceptical about vaccine because of the fake news
circulated on social media and digital media in general. Vaccination in India progressed very
slowly and took huge time to even vaccinate the elderly population. There are many reasons
behind it apart from peoples’ perspectives. Nearly after a year or so it became possible to start
vaccination for young people who are below 18 years age. Most of the young population is still
not vaccinated, even with the first dose!
We have taken up this study titled “A case-study on vaccination in India” because we
wanted to visualize people’s reliability on the vaccines provided in this country by different
companies, the different parameters in the vaccination process with respect to the resident area
types of residents etc. We were also interested to see if there are any patterns for different age
groups, gender and resident area towards the prejudices.
We will dive deep into visualization as we proceed in this project and draw meaningful
inferences on the vaccination in India. The study will involve different parameters which are
interlinked and the results will be multi-dimensional. 
We have taken up this project in the first place because we noticed indifference in
people’s mind about vaccine around us. Everyday there is a new rumour about vaccines and
even about covid that comes up and people start being panicky about it. We have set our
priorities straight for this project. The main purposes in which we are focusing are,
 How many people think vaccination is safe and does it depend on different
age intervals, gender and resident places of the subjects?
 What is the vaccination status of the subjects who participated in the study
and do age, gender and resident area have a role to play in this?
 What is difference in vaccination status of the people who think vaccination is
safe versus who feel the opposite?
 On which type of vaccine providing body people are mostly relying –
Government or private organisations? Do age and resident of living have any
effect on this mindset?
 Which type of resident area shows maximum vaccine availability, that is
subjects from which resident area had to travel least to get a vaccine jab?
 How many people used CoWin app or site to book an appointment for their
vaccination? What is the behaviour across the different age intervals and
resident types regarding use of the app?
 How easy it was for people to book an appointment? Was booking through
CoWin app hassle free?
 On which vaccine producing company or brand people are mostly relying on?
 After which dose of vaccine people are suffering from post-jab symptoms?
Do the different vaccine brands have different behaviour regarding these
symptoms? Are there any behavioural changes with respect to age intervals
and gender regarding post-jab symptoms?
 For those people who did not travel to get the vaccine, that is people who took
the jab in their resident area, how the different parameters were taken care of
when they went to the vaccination centre like - 1. Hygiene, 2. Social
distancing, 3. Waiting time in queue
 Also, we aim to find if the columns are correlated for meaningful inferences.

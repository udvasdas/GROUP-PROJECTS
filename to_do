how easy it was to get a vaccine >> area do you live  (metro/rural)+ did you travel to get a vaccine
vaccination status>> to believe vaccine is safe(we can infer that weather that indivisuals have not taken vaccine due to inavaibility of self dis believe)
travel to get your vaccine jabs>> to waiting time for in queue
those who paid for vaccine>> waiting time
what age group had more health related issues after their respective doses (probably cant find any relation)
paid vaccine >> cowin(maybe)
paid vacccine >> social distancing
difference between paid and free in ease of getting the vaccine appointment
vaccine queue waiting time >> living area+ travel
paid >> rate governments effort (maybe, wont find any relation probably)



visualisation
1.vaccination safe >> age_wise(relative frequency wrt to age)- multiple bar plot (Udvas  done)
2.vaccination safe >> living area- same  (udvas done)
3.vaccination safe >> gender wise- same (udvas done)
4.vaccination status >> age wise+ gender wise (Nilabja done)
5.vaccination status >> living area (Nilabja done)
6.Reliability on vaccine provider >> area of living (Nilabja done)
7.vaccine availability>> travel+living area (Nilabja done)
8.CoWin vs Age (done)
9. Cowin vs living area (done)
10. cowin portal vs ease in using the portal (done Udvas)
11. pie diagram of cowin yes or no and number of people facing problem while using it (done Nilabja)
12. multiple bar plot for choices of vaccines
13. vaccine brand vs symptoms (Udvas done)
14. waiting time >> living area for travel== no (Nilabja done)
15. Hygiene >> living area for travel== no (Udvas done)
16. Social distancing >> travel== no(Nilabja done)
17. agewise and genderwise >>symptoms (Udvas done)
 

This is a downfall---paid vacccine vs government  >> social distancing+ hygine + waiting time 


Relationships to be calculated-
##contingency table for vaccination status and reliability(safe or not )>> association
##how many people got their first choice vaccine (1st to 3rd choices)
##cowin>> vaccation appointment ease
flaws-
1. Place of vaccination should have been included.(vaccination institute included later)
2. not many continuous data included
3. should have considered taking income as a data.
